        <p id="AboutMeText">Hi I`m Scott Heritage and I`m an 18 year old programmer. I have 1 year of expierience working as a web developer but I have been programming since I was 14. I started with a FIRST Tech Challenge (an amateur robot commpetition) Team called "#8461 Elementary my Dear Botson" as a Java developer. This is where I picked up an interest in programming and eventually fell in love with it. I was on the team for 6 years where I eventually became the programming lead and then the overall team leader. During this time I got pretty comfortable in Java doing basic machine code. Also during this time when I was 15 one of my friends reached out to me because he had recently joined a game development studio. They were short on programmers and I was eager to learn how to make games because games had and have always been a huge part of my life. This was how i originally learned about Unity and it was quite an easy transition because I had been working with Java which is very similar to C# the language Unity is written in. We were creating a 2D Metroidvania game called "VoidMaster". I worked with alot of young talented artists who made great stuff but were ultimately not as invested in the project as I was. So I worked on a very nice feeling character controller and some fun game mechanics but ultimately the project fell apart do to a lack of proper leadership and organization. After this my interest in programming kind of stagnated. I was still on the FTC Team and that was great but I didnt do much other projects. That is until one day feeling inspired I decided to enter a game jam. I made a game called Copybot where the idea is that you fight several robot bosses in a boss rush style game and after you defeat each one youcan copy their unique ability to use to fight the next one. This was a very fun project and it got me to learn 3D game development. You can find more info about Copybot and even play it below. Now here is where we get to the part where I start getting paid for my work. In the fall of 2023 I got a job working for my family at a boat salvage yard. Basically the business will take in old or beaten up boat strip them for parts and sell those parts on ebay. I was originally employed just to help catalog the warehouse of parts so that they could be sold on the internet. I realised that I could make a desktop app that would not only make it easier to catalog parts but also connect to the ebay api and list them automatically. This soulution was also expandable in that I could add more api interfaces for different stores like Amazon. My boss liked the idea and so I went ahead and started learning how to use Winforms and the .Net framework to make a catalogging app. After a couple months I had a working product and we connected it to the ebay store. Then I had the idea of making our own website and connecting it to the app with a custom api the same way I did with ebay. So I started learning how to make front facing websites and api backends. I made a sort of Minimum Viable Product which would take JSON data from the api and turn it into store pages where you can buy these boat parts. This is when the business sort of took a down turn and the boss wanted me to transition from programming to just listing things straight to ebay. He believed that my work was a waste of time and money and that the business could be more profitable if we just focused on ebay. This is still my job to this day but i much prefer working in tech and programming which is why im making this website.</p>
